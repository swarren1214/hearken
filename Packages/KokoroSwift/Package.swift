// swift-tools-version: 6.2
// Vendored copy of KokoroSwift 1.0.9 (https://github.com/mlalma/kokoro-ios, MIT).
// Changed for Hearken: its config is copied as "KokoroData" instead of "Resources" (see the
// note in ../MisakiSwift/Package.swift), and it uses the vendored MisakiSwift.

// Also changed for Hearken: built as a static library (no "type: .dynamic"), so it links into
// the app itself. As a dynamic framework from a local package, Xcode didn't embed it in the
// app, and the app crashed at launch with "Library not loaded: @rpath/KokoroSwift.framework".

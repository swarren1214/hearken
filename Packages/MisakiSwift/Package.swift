// swift-tools-version: 6.2
// Vendored copy of MisakiSwift 1.0.4 (https://github.com/mlalma/MisakiSwift, Apache 2.0).
// Changed for Hearken: the dictionaries are copied as "MisakiData" instead of "Resources".
// An iOS resource bundle with a top-level "Resources" folder looks like a macOS bundle to
// codesign, which then fails with "bundle format unrecognized, invalid, or unsuitable".

// Also changed for Hearken: built as a static library (no "type: .dynamic"), so it links into
// the app itself. As a dynamic framework from a local package, Xcode didn't embed it in the
// app, and the app crashed at launch with "Library not loaded: @rpath/MisakiSwift.framework".
